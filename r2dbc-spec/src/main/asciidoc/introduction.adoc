[[introduction.what-is-r2dbc]]
R2DBC stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity.
R2DBC started as an experiment and proof of concept to enable integration of relational databases into systems that use reactive programming models â€“- Reactive in the sense of an event-driven, non-blocking, and functional programming model that does not make assumptions over concurrency or asynchronicity.
Instead, it assumes that scheduling and parallelization happen as part of runtime scheduling.

[[introduction.r2dbc-spi]]
== The R2DBC SPI

The R2DBC SPI provides reactive programmatic access to relational databases from Java and other JVM-based programming languages.

R2DBC specifies a service-provider interface (SPI) that is intended to be implemented by driver vendors and used by client libraries.
By using the R2DBC SPI, applications written in a JVM programming language can run SQL statements and retrieve results by using an underlying data source.
You can also use the R2DBC SPI to interact with multiple data sources in a distributed, heterogeneous environment.
R2DBC targets primarily, but is not limited to, relational databases.
It aims for a range of data sources whose query and statement interface is based on SQL (or an SQL-like dialect) and that represent their data in a tabular form.

A key difference between R2DBC and imperative data access SPIs is the deferred nature of execution. R2DBC is, therefore, based on https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] and uses the concepts of `Publisher` and `Subscriber` to allow non-blocking backpressure-aware data access.

[[introduction.target-audience]]
== Target Audience

This specification is targeted primarily towards:

* Vendors of drivers that implement the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of client implementations who wish to implement a client on top of the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of runtime libraries who wish to embed R2DBC into their eco-system to provide R2DBC runtime services.

This specification is also intended to offer:

* An introduction for end-users whose applications use the R2DBC SPI.
* A starting point for developers of other SPIs layered on top of the R2DBC SPI.

[[introduction.acknowledgements]]
== Acknowledgements

The R2DBC specification work is being conducted as an effort of individuals that recognized the demand for a reactive, standardized API for relational database access.
We want to thank all https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/graphs/contributors[contributing members] for their countless hours of work and discussion.

Thanks also go to Ollie Drotbohm, without whom this initiative would not even exist.
