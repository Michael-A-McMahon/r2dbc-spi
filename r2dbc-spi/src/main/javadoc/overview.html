<a href="https://r2dbc.io">R2DBC</a> is a specification designed for reactive programming with SQL databases.

<p>
    R2DBC stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity. Reactive in the sense of an event-driven, non-blocking, and functional programming model that does not make assumptions over concurrency
    or asynchronicity.
    Instead, it assumes that scheduling and parallelization happen as part of runtime scheduling.
</p>

<p>
    R2DBC specifies a service-provider interface (SPI) that is intended to be implemented by driver vendors and used by client libraries. By using the R2DBC SPI, applications written in a JVM
    programming language can run SQL statements and retrieve results by using an underlying data source. You can also use the R2DBC SPI to interact with multiple data sources in a distributed,
    heterogeneous environment. R2DBC targets primarily, but is not limited to, relational databases. It aims for a range of data sources whose query and statement interface is based on SQL (or an
    SQL-like dialect) and that represent their data in a tabular form.
